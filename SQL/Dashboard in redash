Dashbord description:
1. Determine the Top 10 countries by the largest average number of products per order.
2. Among these countries, we will count the number of goods by buyers and draw a box plot
to identify outliers - buyers with an abnormal amount of goods.
3. Let's see what countries these buyers are located in (errors in the data due to the time zone or bots)
4. Buyer 14646 from the Netherlands makes purchases almost every month and each invoice contains different categories of goods - most likely it is some kind of large wholesale store.
5. Buyers from Ireland also regularly buy in different categories in one invoice, but 14911 more often in small orders, and 14156 less often.
6. A buyer from Australia places orders at a strange time for Australia from 19.00 to 3.00. Either data errors or a bot are possible here.
7. A Swedish customer buys different quantities each month - probably as stock runs out, but more likely to be a more specialized store as he does not purchase goods related to light.
